In our analysis of credit card usage among 9,000 individuals, we employed multiple clustering techniques to segment the data into distinct groups. Initially, we explored various clustering algorithms to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring the most meaningful segmentation. Through rigorous evaluation, we identified the most suitable method for our dataset. Subsequently, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance the interpretability of our results. This comprehensive approach allowed us to uncover significant patterns and insights within the credit card usage data, facilitating a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences. Our findings provide valuable information for targeted marketing strategies and personalized financial services, ultimately contributing to improved customer satisfaction and business performance.
